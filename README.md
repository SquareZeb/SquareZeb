Welcome!

I'm Squarezeb, a youtuber, developer, and mostly a computer geek.
I mostly make videos about technical modding, coding, and etc.
Some languages I mostly program my projects in are either: Python, Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3.
I make a lot of projects including mods for games, tools, and generally what the community wants.
